For a few months, we hired a part-time designer and developer (as many of us who built the site needed to return to other commitments), who added a few new features like the ability to save nonprofits to a list you could see anytime. But our capacity to build on the original version of the site was limited. We built something that was able to run with limited resources, but ideally the site could have grown to the point where we could have hired a few people to work on Dollar a Day full-time.";s:10:"post_title";s:37:"Single Post Template adds the ability";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:4:"post";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-02-20 16:52:44";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-02-20 18:52:44";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:37:"http://www.gentequemuda.com.br/?p=351";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
